fillGaps.py - Finds all files with a given prefix, such as spam001.txt, spam002.txt, and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering (such as if there is a spam001.txt and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt). Renames all the later files to close this gap.

insertGap.py - does the opposite - inserts gaps into numbered files so that a new file can be added
